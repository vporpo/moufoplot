About
-----
 MoufoPlot is an easy-to-use terminal based gnuplot front-end. 

 Why is it easy?
 1. No need to know gnuplot or to write any gnuplot related scripts.
 2. No need to worry about data files or their format.
 3. Control all important plot attributes using command line switches.

 It completely decouples the process of generating the measurements from the
 process of plotting them. 


Features
--------
 1. Completely decouple the process of generating data from plotting them.
 2. Use a single MoufoPlot command to select data and plot them.
 3. Select between several plot types:
    Bar graphs (simple, stacked, clustered, stacked & clustered)
    Line graphs 
    2D Heat maps
 4. Platform independent (bash script).
 5. On-the-fly generation of average. (EXPERIMENTAL).


Installation
------------
 If you don't want to install MoufoPlot, just run it straight away:
 $ ./moufoplot [OPTIONS]

 If you insist on installing it, just copy it to a directory in your path:
 $ sudo cp moufoplot /usr/local/bin/

 OR (if you are lazy enough) just run the install script:
 ./install


Basic Concepts
--------------
 1. Generate Data
   The input of MoufPlot should be placed in a directory (let's say data/).
   Each data number should be placed in a single file. 
   The file name is crucial:
    a. Obviously each file name should be unique
    b. It should encode the parameters used to generate this data, 
       separated by '_'
   For example: size4k_assoc8_cycles is a valid name that corresponds to the 
   simulating cycles of a processor with a 4k sized cache of associativity 8.
   Similarly an energy measurement of a size:2k,assoc:8 configuration would be
   size2k_assoc8_energy.

2. Select Data
  a. Select what to put on each axis:
     Place the cache size on X:
     -x size4k,size8k 
     Place the associativity on Y:
     -y assoc2,assoc4,assoc8 
  b. Filter out the unwanted data, by selecting which ones to keep
     -f cycles
     This will let only the cycles to get through (the energy numbers will not).
  
3. Plot
  moufoplot lets you control the output figure in many ways
  Type: moufoplot --help   to get all the options.
  o plot type: --bar, --stack, --line, --hmap
  o title    : --title "This is the title"
  o legend   : --legend in,right,box,...
  o labels   : --xlabel "Description of the X axis", --ylabel
  o size     : --size 1.0x0.8   (width x height)
  These options get updated frequently, as MoufoPlot gets updated, so please
  check the --help option for an exhaustive list.


Example
-------
 1. Scenario
 - - - - - - -
  In this example I will show how to use moufoplot in the common scenario of
  generating and plotting data that are the output of simulations.
  Each simulation run is controlled by say 3 parameters: A, B and C.
  The values of A are 1,2,3
  The values of B are 100,200,300,400,500
  The values of C are 4.1, 4.2

  The simulator outputs 3 results: TIME, ENERGY, AREA.

 2. Generating data
 - - - - - - - - - - 
  Each simulation run is therefore encoded as Ax_By_Cz_<TYPE>, where:
  1) x,y,z are numbers in {1,2,3}, {100,200,300,400,500}, {4.1, 4.2} 
     respectively
  2) <TYPE> is one of {TIME,ENERGY,AREA}
  We use this exact encoding as the file name where each of the simulation 
  result will be placed.
  For example the simulation results for A=1, B=300, C=4.2 will be placed in:
   A1_B300_C4.2_TIME
   A1_B300_C4.2_ENERGY
   A1_B300_C4.2_AREA

 3. Plotting using MoufoPlot
 - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
  A. Let's say we want to plot TIME for A in {1,2,3} and B=200, C=4.1
  moufoplot -x A1,A2,A3 -f "B200 C4.1 TIME"

  B. Let's say we want to plot TIME for A in {1,2,3} and B in {100,200}, C=4.1
  moufoplot -x A1,A2,A3 -y B100,B200 -f "C4.1 TIME"


More Examples
--------------
 Check out the examples/ directory.
 Each of the sub-folders contains an example set of data in the data/ directory
 and some sample MoufoPlot commands in the moufoplot_cmd* files.
 You can directly run the moufoplot_cmd* files to see the output.
